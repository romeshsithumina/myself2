    Hailing from a middle class family of Bihar, I am Naresh Chukla. I am currently studying in class 10th. I feel glad to be the part of this great school with the such 
    great friends, helpful and loving teacher and sound school administration.
    <br>
    <br>
    No one comes in this world at the stage where I am right now, without the support of family and friends. In fact, 
    what I am today, is because of my family. My father is a reputable business man in our community. My mothers is a doctor. They both love their profession. 
    That’s I have learned from my parents the value of time, sincerity, hard work and dedication to the purpose.
    <br>
    <br>
    We are three brothers and sisters. Being the eldest I am the most responsible from my brothers and sisters. 
    I am needed to guide and take care of my other siblings. We all study in the same school. Reading is my passion. I am an avid reader of Novels and history books.
     I have a keen interest in Indian History and classical architecture. I love to read books that describe the rich history and civilization of ancient India. 
    Apart from history, I love to read the novels of Shakespeare.
    <br>
    <br>
    Though I am rarely free from my routine works. But whenever, I am free I love playing luddo game with my friends. 
    I have the top scorer in this game, in fact. I have a little interest in online gaming. I rarely use my personal computer and Mobile device for games. 
    I love to value my time for the good of my future.
    <br>
    <br>
    Friends are the best mirrors of a person. In fact, the circle of friends you chose to stay with, does define your personality and priorities. 
    I am fortunate enough to have the best ever friends in my company. Haresh is my best friends. Not only he is my best friend but he is my class fellow as well. 
    He has been the top scorer in my class.
    I am kind, gentle and sincere individual.
    <br>
    <br>
    I love time management and discipline in life. I have learned all of these value from my parents. My father is my true inspiration. 
    He has groomed me like himself. I am quite inspired by him and that has been the single aim of my life to serve the people selflessly, as my father does.
    <br>
    <br>
    Time is quite a precious commodity. One should exercise minimum care in utilizing one;s time. I have learned throughout all the years of my life, 
    the good value of time and discipline. I love having the time management, sound strategy and clear cut goals in the life.
    <br>
    <br
    My life is full of experiments and achievements. I have got success many times and many times I have failed also. 
    This all has truly taught me the importance of rising again and strike. I continue to update myself to be the better version of myself.
    <br>
    Although no one can be described in a few set of sentences. One need to have though command of oneself before going to write something about his life. 
    That’s to say my life has become what an essence of all of my achievements and struggles.
